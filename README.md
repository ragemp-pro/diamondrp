# Installation
Let's break it down so it's clear to everyone.

1. You need to download the complete resource on GitHub, as well as the database (there are two provided, one clean, the other with real player accounts).
2. Unpack the resulting archives in a convenient place for you.
3. Next you need to install NodeJS modules. To do this we write `npm i` (You must have NodeJS installed).
4. Now you can build the project, type `npm run build` to start the build.
